<h1>HOW TO RUN THE CODE</h1>

<h2>Single file exercises</h2>

If you want to execute the single file exercises, like e.g. `01-casting.java`, you can open your command line and execute `java 01-casting.java`.

Alternatively, you can open your IDE (Visual Studio Code, Intellij IDEA), create a MiaClass class, paste the code in the and execute it.

<h2>Exercise projects (in folders)</h2>

If you want to execute the exercise project i.e. exercise inside a separate folder, you can open the folder inside your IDE (Visual Studio Code, Intellij IDEA) and then execute it.
